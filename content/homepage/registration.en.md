Registration is not open yet.

Since we only have limited sleeping places available - see [overnight](#accommodation) - you should register in advance. This is the only way we can guarantee that you will have a roof over your head at night.

### Prices

- Convention ticket (3 days, 2x breakfast & overnight stay): **€ 30**
- Day ticket: **€ 10**

We also offer a _Soli_ ticket for **€ 20**. Gladly take advantage if chaos has torn a hole in your wallet.

_Children under 12 years pay half the price. Children under 6 years get free entrance to the convention._
