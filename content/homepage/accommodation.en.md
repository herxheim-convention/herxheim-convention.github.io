You can spend the night with us in _classrooms_ of the [school](#location) directly next to the juggling hall. It is best to bring a sleeping mat and a sleeping bag.

Alternatively, you can also pack your _tent_ and spend the night on the lawn of the school.

_{{<icon class="fa fa-warning">}} Please note that we have limited sleeping spaces, so it's best to use our {{<extlink icon="fa fa-external-link" text="preregistration" href="https://anmeldung.landau-jongliert.de/p/en-US/registration/new">}} to secure your overnight spot._

_{{<icon class="fa fa-warning">}} Due to non-determinism, we will not be able to use the showers in the juggling hall this year. However, showers will be available for you at a [500m away sports field](#location) (don't worry, they're indoors)._
